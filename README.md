# TransCrypt
------------
This repository is created to deliver an MVP for a product that provides the students with their digital academic documents. Our core focus building TransCrypt is to implement Agile software development methodologies for incremental delivery of features in the application. 
This is done as a final project for the course _SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES (BCDV1009 - George Brown College)_.
